Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points. 
It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, therefore occasionally being called the Pythagorean distance.
The distance between any two point is absolute value |p-q| --> sqrt(p-q
In higher dimension the distance between p and q is:
sqrt[(p1-q1)**2+(p2-q2)**2+...]

Then the python program draw a triangle with right angle calculate for A,B,C as
A = (b**2+c**2-a**2)/(a*b*c) 
 in def triangle(a,b,c,A,B,C)
