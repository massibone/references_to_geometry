In int_ext_angle.py given some points program detect if angles are inner or outer Angle

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"find_angle-line.py" is an alternative solution using the formula:

 tan = | (m2-m1) / 1 + (m2 * m1) |

where 'm1' is the slope of line 1 and 'm2' the slope of line 2.
If line 1 is defined by the points P1 = [x1, y1] and P2 = [x2, y2], 
then slope 'm' is:

m= y2-y1 / x2-x1

#By using the formulas above you can find the angle in degrees between two lines
