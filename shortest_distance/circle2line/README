What is the shortest distance of the center of the circle given below to the line, 
 y = 2x + 10. x² + y² - 6x + 12y + 9 = 0?

The shortest distance to the line from any point is 
a segment of a perpendicular line that passes through the point.
the eq can be written x² + y² - 6x + 12y + 9 = 0 in (x+p/2)²+(y+p/2)² = p²/2
the equation of the circle in the form (x−h)²+(y−k)²=r²
 where (h,k)
is the center and ris the radius.
h= - (p/2) = (p²/2)**0,5
 
h = -(-6/2(1)) = 3; k = -(12/2(1) = -6. The circle center is (3, -6)
The equation of the perpendicular line is y + 6 = -½(x - 3) → y = -½x - 4.5
 now resolve y = 2x + 10 with y = -½x - 4.5 --> we have x=-29/5
 so y= -8/5
 the shortest distance equation: d = √((3-(-29/5))² + (-6 - (-8/5))²)
