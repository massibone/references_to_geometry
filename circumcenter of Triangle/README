In triangle geometry, a circumcevian triangle is a special triangle associated with the reference triangle and a point in the plane of the triangle.
In another way Circumcenter of a triangle is the point of intersection of all three perpendicular bisectors of the triangle.
For example D = midpoint of AB
D = [(x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2]

A = (5, 4)

B = (3, 1)

C = (6, 1)

D= [4.5 , 2]
