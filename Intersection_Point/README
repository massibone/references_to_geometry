Point of intersection is the point where two lines or two curves meet each other.
The point of intersection of two lines of two curves is a point. 
If two planes meet each other then the point of intersection is a line

In intersectionpoint.py when lines are parallel the program
return a pair of FLT_MAX
line AB is  a1x + b1y = c1
line CD is  a2x + b2y = c2
